Base is a Layer 2 blockchain solution developed by Coinbase to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs on the Ethereum network. It fully supports Ethereum smart contracts, enabling developers to deploy decentralized applications seamlessly.

Users can transfer ETH to Base using compatible wallets by sending funds to addresses such as jesse.base.eth, leveraging the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for user-friendly transactions.

Base enables staking opportunities through various integrated decentralized applications (dApps), allowing users to participate in network security and earn rewards.

This blockchain was developed in collaboration with Optimism, utilizing their OP Stack technology to ensure high performance, security, and Ethereum compatibility.
